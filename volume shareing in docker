###Here's a script that creates Docker containers named con1, con2, etc., based on an Ubuntu image, creates an image using a Dockerfile, and shares a volume between the containers:

#!/bin/bash

# Set Docker Hub ID
docker_hub_id="evilpagal"

# Function to build Docker image from Dockerfile
build_image() {
    local tag="$1"
    echo "Building Docker image $tag..."
    docker build -t $tag .
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Failed to build Docker image $tag."
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Function to create Docker containers and share volume between them
create_containers() {
    local container_names=("con1" "con2" "con3")  # Add more container names as needed
    local image_tag="$1"
    local host_path="/host/path"
    local container_path="/container/path"

    echo "Creating Docker containers based on image $image_tag..."

    for container_name in "${container_names[@]}"; do
        echo "Creating container $container_name..."
        docker run -d --name $container_name -v $host_path:$container_path $image_tag
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Failed to create container $container_name."
            exit 1
        fi
    done

    echo "Docker containers created successfully."
}

# Check if Docker is installed
if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Docker is not installed. Please install Docker and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if Dockerfile exists
if [ ! -f Dockerfile ]; then
    echo "Dockerfile not found. Please create a Dockerfile and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Build Docker image from Dockerfile
build_image "$docker_hub_id/ubuntu_image"

# Create Docker containers and share volume between them
create_containers "$docker_hub_id/ubuntu_image"
