###Here's a script for creating multiple containers from a Ubuntu image, naming them with a pattern, sharing a volume, and leveraging

#!/bin/bash

# Set the number of containers (modify as needed)
NUM_CONTAINERS=2

# Base image name
IMAGE_NAME="evilpagal/ubuntu:latest"

# Shared volume name
SHARED_VOLUME="shared-data"

# Function to create a container with a numbered name
create_container() {
  local container_name="con$1"
  echo "Creating container: $container_name..."
  docker run -dt \
    --name "$container_name" \
    -v $SHARED_VOLUME:/shared \
    $IMAGE_NAME
}

# Create the shared volume (if it doesn't exist)
docker volume create $SHARED_VOLUME >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

# Create containers
for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_CONTAINERS); do
  create_container $i
done

echo "Created $NUM_CONTAINERS containers with shared volume '$SHARED_VOLUME'."
